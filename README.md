# BA Thesis: Evaluation of Open-Source-Routing-Engines

This repository contains the source code created for a BA thesis focusing on the evaluation of routing engines. It represents the basic testing environment and includes the developed tool called **Way-Wise**.

## Overview

**Way-Wise** is a tool designed to evaluate various routing engines. The repository also includes exploratory implementations using Indiestax of Remix.run and some experiments with ChatGPT code generation. These generated codes are marked within the source.

### Note

The code in this repository is not intended for production. It serves more as a notebook of the author, containing exploratory and experimental implementations.

## Structure

- **way-wise**: Core tool and testing environment
- **docker-valhalla**: Docker setup for Valhalla routing engine
- **graphhopper**: Integration with GraphHopper routing engine
- **iris**: Iris integration (details to be added)
- **osrm-backend**: OSRM routing engine setup

## Known Issues and Refactoring

### Refactoring Needed

- **Hardcoded URLs**: Several URLs in the code are hardcoded. These should be replaced with environment variables (`.env`).
- **Configuration for Valhalla**: Currently included in `fetchAllBenchmarks.ts`. This should be moved to a separate JSON configuration file.
- **Redundant Code**: There is redundant code that should be optimized and better organized.
- **Type Organization**: Types should be better organized for improved code maintainability.
- **Styling with Tailwind**: Some styling is partially inline, which could be improved by adhering to best practices with Tailwind CSS.

### Known Bugs

- **UI Bugs**: Several known bugs affect the UI. These need fixing before considering further development.
- **Snapshot Updating**: The updating of the snapshots is buggy.
- **Comprehension Module for Snapshots**: There is a bug in the overall comprehension module for the snapshots. For the thesis, this was manually checked.

## Future Development

After refactoring and fixing known bugs, the tool could theoretically be used for:

- **Qualitative Analysis of Polylines**: Developing scripts for better comprehension of polylines generated by routing engines.
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Implementing further scripts to evaluate the efficiency of the routing engines.

### Database Schema Refactoring

- **Geometry Size**: The geometries in the database schema are too large, causing significant slowdowns in requests. Excluding them with Prisma is cumbersome.
- **Typos**: There are some typos in the schema that need fixing.
- **Database Cleanup**: A method to clean up the database is needed, including the definition of cascading deletions in the schema.

## Experimentation and Generated Code

- **Remix.run**: Exploration of Indiestax of Remix.run
    
- **ChatGPT**: Experimentation with ChatGPT code generation. Generated code sections are marked within the source.
    
    - The code generation by GPT is very old school and not really up to date with the latest ECMAScript. It was useful for generating boilerplate code but proved buggy and often outdated when dealing with logic.
    - For non-pixel perfect styling ideas, GPT was great to use, especially as inline code with Tailwind CSS. However, for best practices, it was not usable.
    - Generating READMEs and fixing details was a great time saver with GPT.
- **Partial README Generation**: Parts of this README were generated using GPT-4.
    
- **Remix.run Indistack**: The Remix.run Indistack is a great basic stack for mid-sized web applications. The features that come with Remix, like streaming UI, seem to be great for building modern UIs with a great user experience.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node.js
- NPM or Yarn

## Setup Instructions

The instructions to set up the test environments are split into several README files, which can be found in the respective directories. 

## Contribution
There will be no contributions and no maintenance as this is just an additional appendix for the thesis.
