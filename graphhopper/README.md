# GraphHopper Setup and Usage Guide

This guide will help you clone the GraphHopper repository, build a Docker image, download the necessary OSM map, and configure GraphHopper with a basic truck profile. Additionally, it provides instructions for ensuring the correct endpoint URLs for way-wise if running your own GraphHopper instance.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Git

## Steps

### 1\. Clone the GraphHopper Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper.git` 

This will clone the GraphHopper repository into your current directory.

### 2\. Build the GraphHopper Docker Image

Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

`cd graphhopper` 

Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:


`docker build -t graphhopper-image .` 

### 3\. Download the OSM Map

Download the OSM map file to the current directory. You can use a command like `wget` to download the map. Replace `<OSM_MAP_URL>` with the actual URL of the map you want to download.

bash

Code kopieren

`wget -O map.osm.pbf <OSM_MAP_URL>` 

### 4\. Configure GraphHopper

GraphHopper can be configured using a `config-example.yml` file. Below is an example configuration for a basic truck profile.


### 6\. Ensuring Correct Endpoint URLs for way-wise

If you are running your own GraphHopper instance, ensure that the `way-wise` service has the matching endpoint URLs configured. Update the `way-wise` configuration to point to your GraphHopper instance URL, typically `http://localhost:8989`.
